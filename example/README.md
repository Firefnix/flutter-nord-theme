# Examples

`simple_example.dart` is, as the name suggests, a simple example of how to
use this package. Its content can be copy-pasted into a `main.dart`.

A more complete (and complex) example can be found in `full_example/`. It
showcases a few widgets, and you can switch between the light and the dark
theme by opening the side drawer then clicking on the switch.
